Create a small project using React, Material-ui, React Router and Apollo Graphql.
You will use the public graphql api from the German railway system: https://bahnql.herokuapp.com/graphql

Functionality 
- Create a form that allows users to search stations by name (the names are based on cities (Hannover, etc))
- The form will show lists of station names that updates as the user types
- As the user types, make sure no more than 1 request is sent per 250ms
- Allow the user to click on a result to go to a detail page
- Display a number of icons based on at least 5 of the available services at that station
- Maintain a list that displays the last 5 detail pages that were visited and display it in the front end

Requirements
- Use Material-ui for all UI components 
- Use hooks for all Apollo queries
- Avoid the use of React classes
- Test your front end code functionality using react-testing-library*********
- Publish the result on Github and make a small video demoing your project and explaining the choices you made
- Use the minimum amount of third party libraries necessary other than the aforementioned libs. 
- Structure your component hierarchy in a sensible way
